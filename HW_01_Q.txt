Question 1 (2 pt):
Use MATLAB to answer the following questions:
	a. Define a variable called var11 and set it equal to the sum of 5 and 3. Display the value of var11 using the syntax described above.
	b. Define a variable called var12 and set it equal to the subtraction of 3 from 10. Display the value of var12 using the syntax described above.
	c. Define a variable called var13 and set it equal to the multiplication of 5 and -3. Display the value of var13 using the syntax described above.
	d. Define a variable called var14 and set it equal to 10 raised to the power of 3. Display the value of var14 using the syntax described above.


Question 2 (2 pt):
Use MATLAB to answer the following questions. Store each output in a variable with the name of your choice. Display the value of the variable using the syntax described above:
	a. Calculate the square root of 5
	b. Calculate the natural base e raised to the 3rd power
	c. Round 10.4 to 10 using two different MATLAB functions. Display both as Question 2c method 1 or Question 2C method 2.
	d. Round the sin of 46 to the lowest nearest integer


Question 3 (2 pt):
	Use the help or doc functions on the command line to investigate the "format" function. Determine the correct option of "format" that will display the output of 5/16 + 2/7 as 67/112 instead of its decimal equivalent. Store the MATLAB command that will achieve this in a string with variable name of your choice, and display the string using "disp". Ensure that your string includes “Question 3:” at the beginning. For example, if my format was short fixed decimal, I would display “Question 3: format short”.


Question 4 (2 pt):
A horse weighs on average 1000 lbs. Use MATLAB to do the following:
	a. Create a variable called horsePounds and store the horse’s weight in pounds. Display the horses weight in pounds using a complete sentence (note that complete sentences should include units).
	b. Convert this weight to kilos using the conversion factor 1kg = 2.2 lbs, and store a new variable called horseKilos with the converted horse weight in kg. Display the horses weight in kilos using a complete sentence (note that complete sentences should include units).


Question 5 (2 pt):
	The molecular formula for starch is C6 H10 O5. We can assume the molecular weight of carbon is 12.011 g/mol, oxygen is 15.99 g/mol, and hydrogen is 1.008 g/mol. Store the molecular weights for each element in three separate variables, and use these variables to calculate the overall molar mass. Display the overall molar mass in a complete sentence (note that a complete sentence should include units).


Question 6 (2 pt):
	Choose any temperature in Fahrenheit (F), and store this temperature in the variable called ftemp. Convert ftemp to degrees Celsius and store the output is stored in a variable called ctemp. Display in a complete sentence the original and converted temperature values. The conversion factor is subtracting 32 from F, and multiplying this value by 5/9.


Question 7 (2 pt):
	Define two variables that each store the number 10; the first should store it as a numeric variable of class ‘double’, and the second as a string variable type of class ‘string’. In the display for this question, simply write: disp(“Question 7: see line #’s...”), where the sentence is completed with line numbers in your script that the grader should refer to.


Question 8 (2 pt):
Write an algorithm that does the following, making sure to suppress all outputs except the last one:
	Step 1: Stores the number 10 as a numeric variable
	Step 2: Increments this number in steps of 2 by storing a new variable at each step, until the value 16 is reached
	Step 3: Displays the final value in a complete sentence
