A box is 12 inches high, 8 inches long and 2 inches wide.
Currently 30% of the boxâ€™s surface area is covered.
Write a script that
(1) calculates the surface area (SA) of the box,
(2) calculates the amount of SA that is covered (e.g., 30%), and
(3) displays the amount of the SA that is uncovered in a complete sentence.

Use the formula below:
	SA = 2*l*w + 2*l*h + 2*h*w

Rules to follow (same for HW):
	No hard-coded numbers beyond the minimum necessary
	Suppress everything that is not the script output
